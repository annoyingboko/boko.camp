### My History with YouTube

My main presence online has always been through YouTube, which has had many ups and downs for me, including taking a two year break when Covid hit.

> Here you can find a timeline of my channel and what I did with it, all the way up till the creation of this website, in 2022.

| *2016* | &nbsp;**Channel Creation**
|        | At the time I was very excited for the release of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and as such I decided to make a YouTube channel as a way to express that and theorise about stuff.
|        | Most of the videos were nothing special, some of them even outright weird, but I look back on it fondly for how excited I was with it, and how I just did whatever I wanted regardless of my small size at the time.

| *2017* | &nbsp;**Breath of the Wild Release**
|        | With the game actually out, I switched over to making gameplay videos about weird ways to play the game. This was when I 'blew up'.
|        | I stuck with this until towards the end of 2018.

| *2019* | &nbsp;**Changing Things Up**
|        | Around the start of 2019 I started running out of ideas for my gameplay content, as well as it getting boring, so I wanted to change things up. I tried a bunch of different things but never really went anywhere with it.
|        | &nbsp;**Breath of the Wild 2**
|        | Around halfway through 2019, the trailer for the sequel to Breath of the Wild dropped. From this, I bounded off moving to a more theory/speculation form of content, similar to my original content but of a higher quality.
|        | I started this off with a collab video with [Infin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPGzAE_H9aeTPj9KZTE9Flw).

| *2020* | &nbsp;**Start of the Year**
|        | I continued into 2020 making the same content, during this time I released probably my favourite video from that time, [about ancient energy](https://youtu.be/OcnIHJPtAZ0).
|        | &nbsp;**COVID-19**
|        | Covid hit, and much like for everyone else, it hit hard. I suddenly had infinite free time, which is a very weird position to be in, and ultimately left me doing nothing. Combine this with personal issues at the time, and video production came to a halt.

| *2021* | &nbsp;**An Attempted Return**
|        | Come the start of 2021 and I was wanting to come back to YouTube, but I felt like my old content had limited me to just Zelda, and wanted change.
|        | So, I began work on creating a new brand for my Channel, designed to be unrelated to any game, and let me cover anything I wanted.
|        | This went on until July, during which I made a [trial video](https://youtu.be/udeHM4HlyN4) to test out the new ideas, which I am really happy with to this day *(a rarity)*.
|        | However, in the end, nothing came of it and I still left not actually getting into making anything.

| *2022* | &nbsp;**The Return**
|        | Having been further thinking about it, I came to a new conclusion. It wasn't Zelda that was limiting me, it was just the idea of any set standard at all, including the whole new brand I tried designing in 2021.
|        | With this realisation in mind, we come to the present, me writing this. I'm now ready to make videos again, with the plan to just do whatever I want and not let anything restrict that. I've been making this website precisely to help with that, as another creative outlet for myself with no restrictions.
