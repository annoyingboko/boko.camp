# About

Hi I'm Boko, and I love procrastinating.  
<i>Welcome to the place where I put stuff when I actually don't do that for once.</i>

I'm into all things technology, mainly games, and upload videos to [YouTube](channel), as well as stream on [Twitch](live).

### Q & A

##### What games do you play?
- I enjoy anything so long as it's good (my opinion is factual).
- My favourite game of all time was Horizon Zero Dawn, and now is Horizon Forbidden West.
- Some of my other favourites are Genshin Impact, Zelda, Xenoblade, ~~Among Us~~, Hollow Knight, Persona 5, Octopath Traveller and Astral Chain.

##### What software / hardware / setup do you use?
- See my [setup]({%- link setup.md -%}) page for full details!
