<!--more-->

After a year, finally the "grand" return!  
This will be the first out of hopefully a bunch more videos.

This video isn't too long or complex, more just something I made as a way of getting back into things, but honestly I'm happy with it. The one ~~kinda noticeable~~ flaw with it, is that the camera wasn't properly focused when filming, but other than that I think it's pretty nice - especially considering I made it in under two days!

#### Using Resolve

This video was also my first time using DaVinci Resolve!  
I've heard a bunch in the past that it's on an equal level to Premiere Pro, but free.
However I never bothered switching because if it was equal, it was just wasted effort to me.

But now that I'm editing on Linux, I swapped over to resolve as it has honestly really amazing Linux support, and damn it's good. I'd go as far as to say that it's better than Premiere Pro, not equal.

The workflow is just so intuitive to me, easy to use, and even has in-house effects rather than requiring separate software like with Premiere. I'll totally be using it from here-on out!
