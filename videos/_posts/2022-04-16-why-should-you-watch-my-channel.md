##### My second video returning to the channel!

This video is a bit shorter, but for a reason. Originally I was just going to make it as a regular video, satirically talking about my channel - but then I had the idea to turn it into a satirical ad for my channel instead, which just felt perfect.

Presenting the video as an advert filled several roles:
- I needed a new channel trailer for the new content
- It worked well as a 'preview' of a sorts for what upcoming content will be like, as I'm still just starting
- It still functions fine as a standalone video at any time in the future

Using the video as a channel trailer is why I ended up deciding to make it only a minute long. However to compensate this, I managed to fit in way more 'skits' than previously done.

#### The 'Skits'

From the two videos I've done so far, plus the experimental one last year, I've really found the 'skits' I've done to fit perfectly.
Everyone seems to enjoy watching them, and I really enjoy making them.

I was originally more reserved about using 'skits' as I felt I lacked imagination for them.  
Back last year making the [experimental video]({%- link videos/_posts/2021-07-18-skyward-sword-a-plot-summary.md -%}), most skits were thought up by my friend Arsh, since I couldn't really think of any but still wanted to include some nonetheless.

However, coming back to making videos this year, I've been able to think up all the skits on my own, which has really boosted my confidence around them. Making the [Genshin Disease video]({%- link videos/_posts/2022-04-08-genshin-impact-disease-a-review.md -%}), I was only able to think of a few skits, but making this one I thought of way more, which has also helped me feel better about the idea too.

I'll definitely be including more of the skits to come, plus maybe even ramping it up a bit if I can.
