A video I made describing the plot of Skyward Sword from a more ~~unfunny~~ *'humorous'* view, coming from having played the game a ton for basically 10 years leading up to then.

I made this video as a demo of sorts for what a new kind of content on the channel could be and it was a fun experience making it.
Skyward Sword is my all-time favourite Zelda game, and was my favourite game in general before I found Horizon *(although that's for another video lmao)*, so this was the perfect topic for me to cover when testing out a new type of content.

### Producing the Video

I've always found the overall process of producing a full video to be challenging, as I'm bad at both writing and following scripts, and also struggle with my imagination.
The plan going into this was to try and figure out something that worked, below are the steps I took and some reasoning:

1.  I kind of just spontaneously chose a topic and talked about it into a microphone, no script present. That recording is the one present in the final video. I've found that this worked really well for getting me to actually start on the video, as I usually put off scripting and then just never make the video. Although the unscripted nature does come across, as several people have told me. So for future I plan to do this, but then re-record what I said a second time in a more planned manner.

2.  Once the voice recording was done, I brainstormed different skits I could include alongside it. Due to not having the best imagination for this kind of stuff, Arsh helped me with suggestions. Honestly I couldn't have finished it without the help.

3.  With different skit ideas in mind, I decomposed the video into different *'segments'*. A segment being a part of the recording which I wanted something to play alongside, such as a skit. I assigned different skits to relevant parts, and then filled the rest with various animations, images, or video footage. Further down I've included a copy of how I planned this out.

4.  Before anything else, I went out to record the different skits, which took me about 2 days. (The 14th and 15th)

5.  Finally, everything was ready and just needed editing together. Editing is my favourite part of the process, so this went through very quickly, taking just the 16th and 17th. I did a lot of the editing in a voice chat in my Discord server (totally not a promo to [join](/server)...).

6.  With the video ready, came releasing. For that all I needed was a thumbnail and then to upload to YouTube. For the thumbnail I used two drawings from the video itself plus some big text.

The video released on the 18th of July 2021, and writing this today on the 24th of March 2022, the video still hasn't even hit 1000 views. However I don't care. Which to me, means the video was a success, as one of my largest difficulties which I aimed to overcome with this video, was struggling with the mentality of view counts on YouTube.

#### Rough Video Plan

link land on floor - amiibo land on floor
link running around killing bokoblins - link arguing with bokoblins over a corpse of one

ghirahim amazing - funny splash screen (repeated each time)
zelda bomb to past - same scene but bomb kapow
link running around in the sky - he do be running on thin air

door opens and zelda is there - literally open up the original frame into one of zelda
