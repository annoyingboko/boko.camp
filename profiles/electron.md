Hey i am Dev, you can call me Dev or ElectronDev, but you can only call me Dave if you hate amber from genshin impact

I have been in this server for too long, and generally work on the bots here whenever i am not doing my favourite hobby, procrastinating.
I enjoy programming and playing games, if you are interested in what i make then you can ask me about it or look on my website whenever i've done that, not a shameless plug at all i promise, it will have all one of my public projects on it.
