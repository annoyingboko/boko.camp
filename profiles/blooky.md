Whats poppin? I like playing Genshin Impact or Elden Ring or really any game and I work to be better at photoshop / inkscape every day!  I also enjoy anime, and since you asked, they call me Mr. Business, Mr. Cobblestone, Bladez, Ben Cot, Glass Guy, Sunrise Guy, Amazon Prime, Money Jackson, Disco Inferno, Mr. Cereal and Reuben Fries. Please don't ask about what happened in '99 Oh and would you rather unlimited bacon but no games OR games. Unlimited games.. but no games.
